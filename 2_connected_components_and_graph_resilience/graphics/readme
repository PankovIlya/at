Analysis of a computer network

An example computer network - The text representation for the example network is here (1239 nodes and 3047 edges). 

ER graphs - ER undirected graphs.

UPA graphs - undirected UPA graphs. UPATrial class.

To begin our analysis, we will examine the resilience of the computer network under an attack in which servers are chosen at random and using fast targeted order
